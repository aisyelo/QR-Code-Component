## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that I should do the mobile-first layout before the larger screens and I will implement that workflow in the next challenge.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 375px){}
```

### Continued development

I have a hard time coding mobile layouts so I'll be focusing more on responsiveness and media queries in the next challenge. Aside from that, I'll also be learning more on the correct use of position and display in css.
